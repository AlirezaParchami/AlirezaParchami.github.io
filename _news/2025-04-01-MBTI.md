I've joined [Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation (MBTI)](https://www.mercedes-benz-techinnovation.com/en) to write my Master's thesis on **Multi-Modal AI** and **Scene Understanding** for _In-Car XR_ and _Outside-the-Vehicle Referencing (OVR)_.

For this project, I am researching how to accurately predict a passenger's Points of Interest (POIs) from a moving vehicle. This involves end-to-end R&D on sensor fusion, scene understanding, data collection and processing, and the development of effective, real-time machine learning models.

Leveraging the rich availability of sensors in modern cars, we are exploring advanced **multi-modal approaches** to fuse extracted features for highly accurate, real-time predictions.
