<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I'm Alireza &#x1F44B;&#xFE0F;

I'm a research engineer with 4+ years of experience in research and development, having had the privilege to work with incredible teams at Disney Research, EPFL, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation, and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics.

I love to create and innovate, which is why I am passionate about research and turning it into effective applications. For the same reason, I am highly drawn to image synthesis and rendering as it allows to create images that represent the world VISUALLY. You may now have an idea why I chose to study [M.Sc. Visual Computing](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/msc-visual-computing/) at one of Europe's top universities in this field, [Saarland Informatics Campus](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).

I'm open to Research Engineer and R&D roles, as well as PhD opportunities, where I can contribute to projects in Computer Graphics, 3D Vision, Extended Reality, and AI. Beyond career opportunities, I always welcome the chance to connect with fellow researchers and students. If you have anything to chat, feel free to reach out :)
