I designed, developed, tested, and deployed GINI2 application from scratch duing my work at AWS-i.

**GINI2** intends to allow music teachers to provide immersive content for their students and support them to learn basics of drums and notesheet rules through a digital approach.

more information will be published soon. Until then, feel free to watch the project video:

<div class="row justify-content-center" id="gini-video">
    <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/img/projects/2024_GINI2/Media1.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=false %}
    </div>
</div>

<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        // Find the video inside our specific row
        var videoBlock = document.getElementById("gini-video");
        var myVideo = videoBlock.querySelector("video");
        
        // If it finds the video, set the volume to 50%
        if (myVideo) {
            myVideo.volume = 0.5; 
        }
    });
</script>
